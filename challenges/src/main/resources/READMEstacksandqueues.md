<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- Create Node class
- Stack class with methods push, pop, peek, isEmpty
- Queue class with methods enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Add Nodes to Stack last in first out. Have methods to Push(), Remove(), Peek(), and isEmpty(),
-Add Nodes to Queue first in first out. Have methods to enqueue(), dequeue(), peek(), isEmpty(),

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
O(1) Time performance 
Testing utilizes Single-responsibility principle

## API

- Remove top with pop()
- Peek() returns value of the top. 
- isEmpty() returns true or false

-Add Nodes to Queue first in first out
